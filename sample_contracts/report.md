# High Issues

## H-1: ETH transferred without address checks

Consider introducing checks for `msg.sender` to ensure the recipient of the money is as intended.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 25](Fallback.sol#L25)

	```solidity
	    function sendAllocation(address payable allocator) public {
	```

</details>



# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 30](Fallback.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function collectAllocations() public onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Empty `require()` / `revert()` Statement

Use descriptive reason strings or custom errors for revert paths.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 26](Fallback.sol#L26)

	```solidity
	        require(allocations[allocator] > 0);
	```

</details>



## L-3: Modifier Invoked Only Once

Consider removing the modifier or inlining the logic into the calling function.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 16](Fallback.sol#L16)

	```solidity
	    modifier onlyOwner() {
	```

</details>



## L-4: State Change Without Event

There are state variable changes in this function but no event is emitted. Consider emitting an event to enable offchain indexers to track the changes.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 11](Fallback.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function Fal1out() public payable {
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 21](Fallback.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	    function allocate() public payable {
	```

</details>



## L-5: Unsafe ERC20 Operation

ERC20 functions may not behave as expected. For example: return values are not always meaningful. It is recommended to use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 library.

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 27](Fallback.sol#L27)

	```solidity
	        allocator.transfer(allocations[allocator]);
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 31](Fallback.sol#L31)

	```solidity
	        msg.sender.transfer(address(this).balance);
	```

</details>



## L-6: Unspecific Solidity Pragma

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 2](Fallback.sol#L2)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.6.0;
	```

</details>



## L-7: Public Function Not Used Internally

If a function is marked public but is not used internally, consider marking it as `external`.

<details><summary>5 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 11](Fallback.sol#L11)

	```solidity
	    function Fal1out() public payable {
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 21](Fallback.sol#L21)

	```solidity
	    function allocate() public payable {
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 25](Fallback.sol#L25)

	```solidity
	    function sendAllocation(address payable allocator) public {
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 30](Fallback.sol#L30)

	```solidity
	    function collectAllocations() public onlyOwner {
	```

- Found in Fallback.sol [Line: 34](Fallback.sol#L34)

	```solidity
	    function allocatorBalance(address allocator) public view returns (uint256) {
	```
